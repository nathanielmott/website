            <p><em>tl;dr: whoever thought a text editor should be configured in lua was mad</em></p>
<p>I've been using Helix for the last few months, and for the most part, it's great. Configuring it with Rust, Zig, and Markdown has been a snap. Changing various settings to suit my preferences has been a breeze. Launching it with the beloved &quot;hx&quot; command has been a third metaphor for a thing being easy. And, most importantly, Helix's approach to manipulating text makes far more sense to me than Vim and NeoVim's does.</p>
<p>And yet.</p>

            <p><em>tl;dr: learning to program, but with an extended d&amp;d metaphor!</em></p>
<p>I said in <a href="https://www.nathanielmott.com/rust-or-zig-july-2023-idk/">another post</a> that &quot;lately I've been trying to learn programming&quot; following &quot;several kinda-sorta-failed attempts in the past that left me with a passing knowledge of assignments, control flow, etc&quot; but left me feeling &quot;more like I'm using a magic item, in D&amp;D parlance, than casting a spell myself.&quot; The <a href="/content/pages/about.md">about</a> page on this site says &quot;Nathaniel Mott is a bard looking to multiclass into wizard.&quot;</p>
<p>Let me expand on that.</p>

<p>I've spent the last few weeks writing a basic port of the <code>stat</code> command in Rust and Zig. Throughout several iterations of this utility, which has reached the &quot;I'm willing to discuss this in public&quot; stage but not the &quot;I'm willing to post the source code&quot; stage, I've had to confront a difficult question: Rust or Zig?</p>

<p>I recently made two seemingly unrelated decisions: switching to Linux and building my own keyboard. While the exact motivations behind these changes vary, at their core, both were prompted by a desire for greater agency.</p>
