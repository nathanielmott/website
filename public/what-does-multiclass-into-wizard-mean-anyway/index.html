            <p><em>tl;dr: learning to program, but with an extended d&amp;d metaphor!</em></p>
<p>I said in <a href="https://www.nathanielmott.com/rust-or-zig-july-2023-idk/">another post</a> that &quot;lately I've been trying to learn programming&quot; following &quot;several kinda-sorta-failed attempts in the past that left me with a passing knowledge of assignments, control flow, etc&quot; but left me feeling &quot;more like I'm using a magic item, in D&amp;D parlance, than casting a spell myself.&quot; The <a href="/content/pages/about.md">about</a> page on this site says &quot;Nathaniel Mott is a bard looking to multiclass into wizard.&quot;</p>
<p>Let me expand on that.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="struggling-to-learn-cantrips">struggling to learn cantrips</h2>
<p>I've tried to learn how to write software a few times over the years. In 2019 I downloaded Apple's Swift Playgrounds app for the iPad, in 2021 I made my way through Paul Hudson's excellent &quot;100 Days of SwiftUI&quot; course, and in 2022 I bought Dr. Angela Yu's incredibly popular introductory Python course on Udemy. On at least two occasions I also tried to read through &quot;The Rust Programming Language.&quot;</p>
<p>Each of those attempts resulted in some incremental progress. Swift Playgrounds introduced me to basic programming concepts like variables, functions, and control flow; &quot;100 Days of SwiftUI&quot; showed me how those building blocks could be assembled into working software; and Yu's course helped me realize I didn't want to learn Python. That, combined with seemingly everyone's insistence that Rust is the future, led me to what Rust developers call &quot;The Book&quot; over and over and over again.</p>
<p>I finally read the entirety of &quot;The Book&quot; for the first time at the end of June. Then I read through it again, but this time I read Brown University's version, which adds quizzes to each section. I also made my way through &quot;Rust in Action&quot; by Tim McNamara to help put these concepts in context and give me a basic understanding of what the fuck people are talking about when they talk about &quot;systems programming.&quot; (And, of course, watched entirely too many videos about Rust on YouTube.)</p>
<p>That's a lot of reading! I probably should have started a project alongside my second pass through &quot;The Book,&quot; but I didn't want to repeat my previous efforts by completing a few tutorials and then giving up when it came time to write something of my own because I didn't fundamentally understand what I was doing. So I internalized as much about Rust as I could and then wrote a &quot;toy&quot; combining metadata about a given file as well as the number of paragraphs and words within.</p>
<p>I ultimately ended up building two versions of this toy: one in Rust and one in Zig.</p>
<h2 id="trying-a-first-level-spell">trying a first-level spell</h2>
<p>As I put it in the previous post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust's solution feels more like using a magic item. Zig's solution--even though I'm still largely depending on the standard library and zig-datetime module--feels a lot more like I'm learning how to cast a spell. [...] I definitely learned a lot more writing the Zig version of this utility than the Rust version. That was important for this step of my journey to learn programming, and a large part of me would like to stick with Zig for the foreseeable future, especially since I'm not worried about finding a job or anything like that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me be clear: I would love to continue with Zig. But after spending a few more days grappling with the package manager--the alternative to which is messing around with Git submodules, which has led to mixed results, in my experience--I'm firmly leaning towards using Rust until Zig is closer to that hallowed 1.0 milestone.</p>
<p>This wasn't just because of the build system, though. It's also because I realized that part of my problem had little to do with Rust itself and everything to do with the fact that Rust makes me feel stupid in a way that Zig doesn't. (Even though I can't figure out something as simple as managing dependencies in Zig, natch.)</p>
<p>That isn't meant as an indictment of Rust--yet. My current stance is that Rust is <em>complicated</em>, and rather than recognizing that, my ego got in the way. So I've decided to put that aside for now--or at least attempt to--and engage with the staggering amount of learning materials available for programming in Rust. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Future me: I drafted this post several weeks ago. In the time since, I have put out another command-line utility written in Rust, read through a significant chunk of &quot;Programming Rust,&quot; and started &quot;Rust Atomics and Locks&quot; in addition to continuing to engage with other Rust resources. I still have my gripes, but my experience has definitely improved since my initial experiments with the language in June and July. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I do think I would ultimately <em>prefer</em> Zig to Rust. The lack of hidden control flow, ability to achieve most common tasks with just the standard library, and syntax / grammar / whatever you want to call it all seem to make it better suited to my brain. But I'm open to feeling differently about this as I continue to learn Rust.)</p>
<h2 id="multiclassing-not-dual-classing">multiclassing, not dual-classing</h2>
<p>Here's a throwback for people who played Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition: I'm specifically looking to multiclass into wizard, not <a href="https://adnd2e.fandom.com/wiki/Multi-Class_and_Dual-Class_Characters_(PHB)">dual-class</a> into it. </p>
<p>For now I'm content to research new spells on the side. Bards are notorious for being jacks of all trades and masters of none. Why should I be any different?</p>
